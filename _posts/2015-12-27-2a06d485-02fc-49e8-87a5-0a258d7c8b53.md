Wedding photography by a Cambridge-based wedding photographer
![Cambridge wedding photographer](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/d2cd49b6-d975-4d98-8617-644d79a7560f.jpg)

We have been taking pictures in Cambridge for over 17 years and we come highly recommended. So much so that our reputation brought us bookings from all over the UK and Europe (mainly France and Italy).

We specialise in weddings, but we are happy to take all kind of people photography for you, be it portrait photography, couple and family portraits and event photography. However "event photography" is quite a wide speciality in itself as it includes party & anniversary photography, award dinners, company summer & Christmas parties, garden parties, even small weddings can be seen as events in a certain way. Just enquire when sending us a message and we shall be able to help and tell you if we can cover your event or what you have in mind!
